      <p>LANGLEY, VA-A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.<br><br>

      According to the report, sections of the documents- <q>almost invariably the most crucial passages</q> -are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.<br><br>

      CIA Director <strong>Porter Gross</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:</p>
      <ul>
         <li> The Cold War
         <li> The civil-rights movement
         <li> The growth of the international drug trade
      <ul>
